This is the MPlayer samples collection.
You can find samples of various common and uncommon
multimedia formats here. The size of the collection
currently is 54GB and growing.

You are free to download any samples you want, but
if you want to download more than just a few or want
to mirror the whole collection please send a mail to
webmaster(AT)ffmpeg(DOT)org *before* you start
and ask for permission.

We can also ship the samples collection to you for a
reasonable fee, inquire for details.

The best way to download samples is with rsync. If you decide
to fetch a large amount (more than 1GB), please limit the rate
to no more than 50 kBps (use the --bwlimit option of rsync).

Please be aware that this samples collection contains a lot
of files that are very obscure, broken in various ways or
are just simply out of use. Hence, it doesn't make sense
to download all of them, unless you are developing a player
application that will support all and every file format
that was ever conceived.
